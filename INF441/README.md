## Content

- The project focuses on creating a concise grammar for Microjava using ANTLR, aiming to understand compiler functionality. It involves defining rules and patterns in ANTLR to parse Microjava's syntax, serving as the foundation for a Microjava compiler. This project offers valuable insights into compiler construction and programming language design.
